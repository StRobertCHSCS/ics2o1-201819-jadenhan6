## **Introduction**
PyArcadeFormula is a combination of functions, interactive parts and formulae that encompasses the gist of the curricula of
Grade 10 Science and Grade 11 Functions.

It allows for simple, user-friendly calculations, usually done through inputting values through a "calculator" on
different screens; in which after, the Python engine computes and spits out the answer.


## **How to Use**
There are **multiple screens** that are coded to **different formulae**. This means that if one wants to calculate simple 
interest, for example, one must go to the **Simple Interest** screen by navigating to it. 

Of course, it will be stored in the Financial Calculators section of the Functions half of the program.

Once there, the user will see the **formula** of simple interest along with various instructions and precautions to ensure
the program runs as smooth as possible. This includes **variable order inputs**; what variables should be entered in 
first.

As well, there are other formula calculators that just help me study for exams.
