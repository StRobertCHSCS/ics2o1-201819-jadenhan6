# **ICS2O1 CPT - Jaden Han**

## **Introduction**
This program is a combination of functions, interactive parts and formulae that encompasses the gist of the curricula of
Grade 10 Science, Grade 11 Functions and Grade 10 Computer Science.

It allows for simple, user-friendly calculations, usually done through inputting values through a "calculator" on
different screens; in which after, the Python engine computes and spits out the answer.

Where computing is not needed, there are also some diagrams and other amenities
that just honestly help me study for exams really
